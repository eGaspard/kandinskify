Kandinskify

Kandinskify by Michelle Chandra, Pamela Liou, Ziv Schneider, Jason Sigal @ NY Music Hackaathon, May 31 2014

We looked at [Kandinsky's Color Theory for music](http://lettersfrommunich.wikispaces.com/Kandinsky's+Color+Theory) and thought about how we might apply these concepts to a music visualization. 

- Determine color and geometry palette based o song choice using the Echo Nest Track Analysis
- Analyze the sound as the music plays using Web Audio API, and map different parts of the frequency spectrum to different shapes
- Visualizations made with p5.js

We'd like to keep going with this idea to actually implement the Echo Nest track analysis and allow users to Kandinskify any song. For now, Echo Nest stuff is not implememented. NOTE: If you want to play with that stuff you'll need to get your own an Echo Nest API key.
